# contributions

#### if you want to contribute to a page with an error code that's not already made:

1. revisit the page with view-source: and copy that instead of copying the page in html (like `view-source:https://example.com/`)
2. change any variables that change dynamically to something template, or that's not specific to you, you can map below as a guide
3. name the file `index<error code>.html` (i.e `index522.html`)
4. open pull request and pray
